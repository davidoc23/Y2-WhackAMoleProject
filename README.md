# WackAMole
A Wack-A-Mole project we had to do as one of our assesments in Second Year.

This is a remake of the popular game Wack-A-Mole where you have to try and hit as many moles as you can before the timer ends.
There are two grids (3x3) and (5x5)
There is a button to switch between them.

*game still needs to be worked on but it is mostly working apart from the timer not stopping at 0 and keeps counting into the negative numbers*
